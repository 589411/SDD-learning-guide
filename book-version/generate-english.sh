## Translation Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The current system generates the structure for the English version.
For a complete English translation, you have several options:

### Option 1: Professional Translation
- Hire professional translators
- Use translation services (e.g., Gengo, One Hour Translation)
- Cost: ~$0.08-0.15 per word

### Option 2: AI-Assisted Translation
- Use ChatGPT/Claude for translation
- Review and edit for accuracy
- Maintain technical terminology

### Option 3: Community Translation
- Open source translation project
- Crowdsource from community
- Use platforms like Crowdin

## Current Structure

The book structure is defined in `config/book-config-en.yaml`:

- Part 0: Getting Started (4 chapters)
- Part 1: Foundation (2 chapters)
- Part 2: Core (2 chapters)
- Part 3: Practice (3 projects)
- Part 4: Advanced (2 chapters)
- Appendix (5 sections)

Total: 13 chapters + 5 appendices

## Next Steps

1. Translate content from Chinese to English
2. Review and edit translations
3. Test all code examples
4. Proofread for grammar and clarity
5. Upload to Leanpub

## Translation Guidelines

- Preserve code blocks exactly
- Keep technical terms consistent
- Maintain formatting (headers, lists, etc.)
- Adapt examples for international audience
- Ensure cultural appropriateness

# Chapter 0: Preface - The New Paradigm of Software Development in the AI Era

---

**Part:** Getting Started

**Recommended Learning Week:** Before Week 1

---

## üéØ Chapter Overview

In the AI era, the way we develop software is fundamentally changing. This chapter explores how Spec-Driven Development (SDD) combined with AI tools creates a new paradigm that makes programming accessible to non-engineers.

**Estimated Reading Time:** 15 minutes

---

## üìö Core Content

### The Traditional Programming Challenge

For decades, learning to program meant:
- ‚ùå Memorizing complex syntax
- ‚ùå Understanding abstract concepts
- ‚ùå Spending countless hours debugging
- ‚ùå Feeling overwhelmed by technical jargon

This high barrier kept many talented people from entering the field.

### The AI Revolution

AI tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and Claude are changing everything:
- ‚úÖ Write specifications in natural language
- ‚úÖ AI generates code automatically
- ‚úÖ Focus on "what" instead of "how"
- ‚úÖ Rapid prototyping and iteration

### What is Spec-Driven Development?

**Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** is a methodology that puts specifications at the center of the development process.

**Key Principles:**

1. **Specification First**
   - Define what you want before writing code
   - Clear inputs, outputs, and behaviors
   - Example-driven approach

2. **AI as Your Coding Partner**
   - AI understands your specifications
   - Generates implementation code
   - Handles syntax and boilerplate

3. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Test and validate
   - Refine specifications
   - Improve incrementally

### Why SDD + AI Works for Non-Engineers

**Traditional Approach:**
```
Learn Syntax ‚Üí Understand Concepts ‚Üí Write Code ‚Üí Debug ‚Üí Deploy
(Months to years of learning)
```

**SDD + AI Approach:**
```
Describe What You Want ‚Üí AI Generates Code ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Refine
(Weeks to master basics)
```

### Real-World Example

**Without Specification Skills:**
```
"ChatGPT, help me make an app"
‚Üí AI doesn't know what to build
‚Üí Generates useless code
```

**With Specification Skills:**
```
"I need a style analyzer that:
- Input: Text string
- Output: Enthusiasm score (0-100)
- Examples: 
  - 'I love this!' ‚Üí 95
  - 'It's okay' ‚Üí 50
  - 'Not good' ‚Üí 20"
‚Üí AI generates precise, working code
```
